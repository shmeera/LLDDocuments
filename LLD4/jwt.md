Sure, here are brief answers to the JWT related interview questions:

1. **What is JWT and why is it used?**
   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

2. **Can you explain the structure of a JWT?**
   A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains the type of the token and the signing algorithm. The payload contains the claims or the pieces of information being passed about the user and any metadata required. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

3. **What is the difference between JWT and session cookies?**
   Session cookies are stored on the client side and are sent with every request to the server, which can verify the session ID stored in the cookie. JWT, on the other hand, is a token-based approach where the client stores the token and sends it with requests. The server verifies the token without needing to store session data.

4. **How does JWT handle user authentication?**
   Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT for the user and sends it back to the client. The client then includes the JWT in the header of each subsequent request for authentication.

5. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using JWT?**
   Advantages include stateless authentication, scalability, and ease of use with mobile and single page applications. Disadvantages include token size, potential for token theft, and the complexity of managing token expiration and revocation.

6. **How can you ensure the security of a JWT?**
   JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair. Also, sensitive information within a JWT should be encrypted. JWTs should be sent over HTTPS to prevent interception.

7. **What is the difference between encryption and signing in the context of JWT?**
   Signing a JWT means to generate a signature to verify the integrity of the token. Encryption is used when you want to hide the contents of the JWT.

8. **How does JWT handle expiration and revocation?**
   Expiration can be handled by including an expiration time in the payload of the token. Revocation is more complex with JWTs as they are stateless; one approach is to use a token blacklist on the server.

9. **Can you explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric signing in JWT?**
   Symmetric signing uses the same key to sign and verify a token. Asymmetric signing uses a private key to sign the token and a public key to verify it.

10. **How would you store a JWT in a client-side application?**
   JWTs can be stored in cookies or in local storage. Each method has its own security implications.

11. **What are some common use cases for JWT?**
   JWTs are commonly used for authentication and secure information exchange. They can also be used for authorization, where specific roles and privileges for a user can be encoded in the token.

12. **How does JWT help with scalability and decoupling in microservices architecture?**
   JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session data. This makes it easier to scale and decouple services, as any service can verify a JWT.

13. **What is the difference between OAuth2 and JWT?**
   OAuth2 is a protocol that allows applications to request access tokens from an authorization server and use them to make authorized API requests. JWT is a type of access token format that can be used in the OAuth2 protocol.

14. **How can you prevent JWT theft?**
   To prevent JWT theft, always use HTTPS, store tokens securely on the client side, set short expiration times, and consider using refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.

15. **Can you explain how JWT works in a Single Sign-On (SSO) system?**
   In a SSO system, a JWT can be used as an assertion that a user is authenticated. When the user logs in, the SSO system provides a JWT that the user can use to authenticate to other services without needing to log in again.
